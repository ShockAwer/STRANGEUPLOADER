  <h4> basic operation (probably this is the only feature you should remember)</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>&lt;基本&gt; </strong><br>
 In PaintBBS, right-click, ctrl+click, alt+click have the same action. <br>
 Basically, the operation is completed with a single click or right-click. (Except when using Béziers or photocopying) <br>
  </p>
    
  <p>
    <strong>&lt;ツールバー&gt; </strong><br>
 Most of the buttons on the toolbar can be clicked multiple times to switch between functions. <br>
 Right click around. Palette color, mask color, and register current status in the save tool are all right-clicked. <br>
 Conversely, you can click to retrieve the palette color and the state saved in the temporary save tool. <br>
  </p>
     
  <p>
    <strong>lt;Canvas> </strong><br>
 Right-click to eyedropper the color<br>
 Press the right-click in the middle of the process such as BŽzier or copy to reset. <br>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="tokusyu">
  <H4> Special Actions (not necessary to use, but useful once you get used to it) </h4>
  <p>
    <strong>&lt;ツールバー&gt; </strong><br>
 The bar whose value is changed will change slowly if it is moved out of the bar when dragging<br>
 You can use it to make detailed changes. <br>
 The palette returns the color to its default state by Shift+clicking. <br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>lt; Keyboard shortcuts> </strong><br>
 Zoom in with +. <br>
 Undo with Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+U, Ctrl+Alt+Z or Ctrl+Y to start over. <br>
 Copy or Bézier reset in ESC. (same for right-clicking) <br>
 Hold down the space key and drag the canvas to scroll freely. <br>
 Ctrl+Alt+drag to change the line width. <br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>lt;Special use of copy tools> </strong><br>
 Currently, the only navigation between layers is copying and layer merge. To move in a copy, see <br>
 First, select the rectangle on the layer you want to move, select the layer you want to move, and then do the normal copying process<br>
 Go on. This allows you to move between layers. <br>
